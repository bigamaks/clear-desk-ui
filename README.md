## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- npm or yarn

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ticket-app/react-version
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start development server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Build for production**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

## 🔧 Key Implementation Details

### State Management
- Local state with React hooks
- localStorage for session persistence
- Custom authentication store

### Component Architecture
- Functional components with TypeScript
- Custom hook for authentication
- Reusable UI components

### Data Flow
- Client-side routing with React Router
- Form validation with real-time feedback
- localStorage-based data persistence

## 🎨 UI Components Structure

- **Header**: Responsive navigation with auth state
- **Card**: Consistent card design with shadows
- **Button**: Variants for primary, outline, and destructive actions
- **Input**: Form inputs with validation states
- **Modal**: Ticket creation/editing modal

## 🔐 Authentication Flow

1. Session validation on route access
2. localStorage token management (`ticketapp_session`)
3. Automatic redirect for unauthorized access
4. Toast notifications for auth events

# 🔧 Development Notes

## Common Features Across All Versions
- Identical UI/UX design and layout
- Consistent color scheme and typography
- Same authentication flow and validation
- Identical ticket status system
- Responsive design patterns

## Browser Support
- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+

## Performance Considerations
- React: Code splitting with lazy loading
- Vue: Tree shaking and component lazy loading
- Twig: Server-side caching and asset optimization

# 📞 Support

For issues or questions regarding any version:
1. Check framework-specific documentation
2. Review browser console for errors
3. Verify localStorage availability
4. Ensure JavaScript is enabled

All three implementations provide identical functionality with framework-appropriate architecture patterns, demonstrating the same ticket management system across different technology stacks.
